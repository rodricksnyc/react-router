`FilterCollection` provides context for a set of `DashboardFilter`s.
It can store a reference to your application's initialized Looker SDK instance,
used for fetching suggestions on applicable filters.
And it keeps track of the current filter values in case any of the filters are linked,
meaning the suggeestions of one are filtered by the current value of another.
